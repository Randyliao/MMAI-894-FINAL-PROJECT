# MMAI-894-FINAL-PROJECT

This is the main page for team college to review the code part of the MMAI 894 Final project in terms of CNN models construction, we have trainied various models using AUDI and BMW datasets for transfer learning, as well as a generic model built from scratch.

Please download the dataset through https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yqwZVTQyYoWB7arhblLU-R__5GzSE7Nn?usp=sharing

There are two zipped files which are car_images_no_int_BMW_Audi_small and thecarconnectionpicturedataset,which the small dataset removes all the interior images(consider as noise) and the another dataset contains the full set of images.

the car_images_no_int_BMW_Audi_small file is used for deep_learning_finalproject_local.py, and the thecarconnectionpicturedataset is used for Deep_learning_finalproject_glab.py and deep_learning_finalproject_pca.py.

unzipped the files and dropped it to a specific directory, update the directory in the py files accordingly
